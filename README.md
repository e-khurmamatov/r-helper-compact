# R-Helper

A Windows application to control Razer Blade settings w/o Synapse.

## Features

- Performance modes: Battery, Silent, Balanced, Performance, Hyperboost, Custom
- Custom mode: CPU/GPU Low/Medium/High/Boost adjustments with experimental Undervolt option (no idea what it does as it's a preset)
- Fan control: Auto/Manual, with current RPM display
- Keyboard backlight brightness control
- Logo lighting: Static, Breathing, Off
- Battery care: Toggle charging threshold (80%)
- **Razer Laptop Cooling Pad** (USB `1532:0F43`): fan on/off with RPM control (500–3200), underglow lighting (Off / Static / Breathing + brightness)

> **Cooling pad note:** Close Razer Synapse or set the pad to Manual there before using r-helper — both apps control the pad over USB HID and will conflict otherwise. The pad has no real RPM sensor; displayed RPM is the last commanded value.


## Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Run `rhelper.exe`

## Building

One command — release build **and** copy to `dist/rhelper-<version>.exe`:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-release.ps1
```

To refresh `dist/` from an existing release build (no compile):

```powershell
.\scripts\copy-release.ps1
```

Plain `cargo build --release` only writes `target\release\rhelper.exe`; it does **not** update `dist/`.

## Architecture

Core device control via locally vendored `librazer` (derived from razer-ctl)
